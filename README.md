ThatTechedGuy's Arch Rice.

Only for experienced linux users.

Required Dependencies: 
picom-ibhagwam's fork as the Window compositor. Goes well because of the dual_kawase kernel and rounded corner support.
dmenu (check my custom dmenu build)
bspwm as Window Manager.
freetype2-cleartype (AUR) for font-rendering
fontconfig for OSX-like font-emboldening. Check the XML config.
xfce4-panel for the beautiful workspace previews.


TODO:
dunst notifs
more powerful shortcuts for utility control.
